                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>For games we are always quality over quantity. Some games thus get on the shelves really fast, but more complex challenges may take a lot of time.</p>
                                <p>For our workers we primarily value 2 things: person and skill. How do you act around others? Are you talkative, friendly, sociable? Do you bring good atmosphere to the workplace? What can you do with 10 fingers and a keyboard? That's what's the most important to us.</p>

                                <p>If you have forgotten your password you can always use the forgotten password button!</p>

                                <p>In that case contact our customer support with your email. They will ask you a couple of questions to prove your identity, and once everything goes smoothly you'll get your account back in no time!</p>

                                <p>We have a handy contact form you can use down below! Use it to report anything from simple problems like NPC walks too slow to "HELP MY CHARACTER IS SPAZZING OUT AND MAP IS COMPLETELY GLITCHED!!!!!"</p>

                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>We have recently rolled out a new button called "No more!", which censors any and all hate-speech it can detect. It has been rolled out as a part of our recent court case, which mandated that we'd do something about all of it.</p>

                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>Of course! if you weren't aware, fines on big companies like ours are really only a scratch. It is common for big companies lose a lot of money in court, but the amount is barely noticeable compared to profits pulled in each year.</p>
